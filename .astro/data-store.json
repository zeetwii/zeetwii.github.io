Dr. Ashworth sat down with Rob \"The Boss\" Sivilli, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Vision Officer, Chief Compliance Officer (self-certified), and Acting Director of Intersubjective Alignment at Cost Plus Technologies, to discuss the company's groundbreaking paleobiological defense portfolio, the competitive landscape, and why Mr. Sivilli has approximately zero respect for John Hammond.*\n\n---\n\n**Dr. James Nicholas Ashworth, D.Sc.: Rob, thank you for making time. I understand your calendar is, to use the technical term, absolutely catastrophic.**\n\n**Rob \"The Boss\" Sivilli:** Catastrophic is generous. Do you know how many contract modification requests I signed this morning? Neither do I — that's what the Director of Strategic Bureaucratic Optimization is for. But yes, I carved out forty-five minutes. I also billed it to a cost-plus line item, so technically the taxpayer is paying for this interview. You're welcome, America.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Let's begin at the beginning. Cost Plus Technologies has made a significant push into the dinosaur-based defense solutions market. Walk me through the origin of that strategic decision.**\n\n**Sivilli:** About three years ago, I was sitting in a Congressional hearing — as a witness, not a defendant, I want to be very clear about that — and a two-star general leans over to me and says, *\"Rob, what we really need is a heavy ground dominance platform that cannot be reasoned with, does not require a union contract, and will absolutely not unionize.\"* And I said, *\"General, I have exactly one phone call to make.\"*\n\nThat call launched the **ALLOSAUR Heavy Ground Dominance Platform**. Fourteen meters of validated lethality. Section 889 compliant. NDAA-friendly. Fully domestic — well, Cretaceous domestic, which our legal team assures us qualifies.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: As someone with a background in computer science, I find myself curious about the systems architecture underlying the genomic pipeline. But I suspect you're going to redirect me to the DNA sourcing question first.**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(leaning forward)*\n\nYou suspect correctly. And James — may I call you James? — as a fellow PhD, I know you appreciate precision. So let me be precise.\n\nBird DNA. B-I-R-D.\n\nWe use bird DNA. Specifically, a proprietary avian-sourced genomic baseline that our science team — God bless them, every one — has spent years refining. The ALLOSAUR is, taxonomically speaking, a very large bird. This is not a joke. This is a phylogenetic fact that we have weaponized. And before you ask: yes, we documented the ontology. It's in the data dictionary. You can have a copy if you're cleared.\n\nNow, I don't want to name names —\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: You're going to name names.**\n\n**Sivilli:** I'm going to name names. John Hammond. InGen Corporation. The man built a theme park — *a theme park* — on Isla Nublar using *frog DNA*. Frog. DNA. Do you know what frog DNA does to a genome sequence? It introduces sex-switching vulnerabilities into your population. Your entire dinosaur workforce becomes capable of spontaneous reproductive reorganization. That is not a feature. That is a catastrophic program management failure dressed up as \"chaos theory.\"\n\nWe submitted a white paper on this to DARPA in 2019. They said it was \"outside current solicitation parameters.\" InGen failed to win a single DoD contract. I'm just saying those two facts are related.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: To be fair — and I want to be fair, it's a professional obligation — InGen was primarily a commercial venture.**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(long pause)*\n\nA *commercial* venture. On a *classified island*. With *classified animals*. Funded by — and I looked into this — a combination of private investors and what my attorneys describe as \"aggressively ambiguous offshore entities.\" Meanwhile, we filed proper CAGE codes, registered in SAM.gov, and completed our CMMC Level 2 assessment before we sequenced a single strand of theropod genome. That's the difference between a professional defense contractor and a billionaire with a god complex and a helicopter.\n\nAlso, his park had a 100% guest casualty rate on opening weekend. Our ALLOSAUR units have a *controlled* casualty rate. It's in the spec.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: I've spent enough time in acquisition to know that \"it's in the spec\" is doing enormous load-bearing work in that sentence. How do you respond to critics who suggest a 14-meter carnivorous theropod is a non-trivial liability risk?**\n\n**Sivilli:** I respond by referring them to our **Legal Disclaimers** page, which I think speaks for itself. We have indemnification language in that document that covers acts of God, acts of dinosaur, and at least three categories of event that don't have legal names yet.\n\nMore substantively: the ALLOSAUR is a *managed system*. It operates within defined engagement parameters. It has been behaviorally conditioned using a proprietary positive-reinforcement protocol that I cannot discuss in detail because it is covered under a CRADA with a major land-grant university and also because it involves a truly alarming amount of raw beef.\n\nInGen tried to manage their assets with *electric fences*. We use a combination of operant conditioning, geofencing, and what our Chief Behavioral Systems Architect calls \"strategic caloric leverage.\" It's more humane, more effective, and — critically — it does not fail when someone cuts the power.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Hammond has said, on the record, that he \"spared no expense.\" You've described this characterization as, and I'm quoting your internal Slack here, \"delusional.\"**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(audible exhale)*\n\nHe *spared every expense*. The man had a park full of apex predators and his entire security architecture ran on a single workstation operated by a disgruntled employee with a Barbasol can. His IT security posture would not pass a basic RMF assessment. It would not pass a *conversation* about a basic RMF assessment. James, you and I have both sat through ATO reviews. You know that what Hammond built would have been dead on arrival at the first ISSO meeting.\n\nWe operate on a zero-trust architecture. Zero trust for the network. Zero trust for the endpoints. Zero trust for the dinosaurs, frankly — that's just good program management. Our ALLOSAUR units do not have access to the corporate VLAN. That is a design decision I am proud of.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Speaking as someone who has watched DoD IT infrastructure decisions get made in real time — that is the correct decision. Now, what else is in the pipeline?**\n\n**Sivilli:** I can speak obliquely and let the procurement community read between the lines, which is how we've always done business — as you well know.\n\nWe have an upcoming platform in the *aerial dominance* space. Avian genomics again — *bird DNA*, not frog, I cannot stress this enough — that addresses a capability gap in the low-altitude surveillance and interdiction domain. I will not confirm or deny whether it has feathers. I will confirm that it is Section 508 compliant, which I think demonstrates our commitment to inclusive design across all biological platforms.\n\nWe are also exploring *aquatic* options. I won't say more than that. I will say that InGen had the IP rights to a certain *marine-based platform* and let them lapse. Their loss. Our CAGE code's gain.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Final question, and I'll make it appropriately grandiose given the setting. What is the core message you want the defense acquisition community to take away from Cost Plus Technologies?**\n\n**Sivilli:** We are the professionals. We file our paperwork. We use the correct DNA. We do not build theme parks and call them *research facilities*. We do not rely on a single power grid to contain assets that can bite through a Ford Explorer.\n\nWhen you issue that next BAA — when you're staring at a capability gap that no conventional system can fill — we want you to think of us. We want you to think: *\"There's a company out there that took the Cretaceous seriously, that did the genomics right, that built a cost-plus contract structure so elegant it should be in a museum.\"*\n\nAnd then we want you to call our Business Development team, who will be delighted to take your call between the hours of 10 AM and 3 PM, Monday through Thursday, excluding federal holidays and any day following a scheduled ALLOSAUR feeding.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Rob, on behalf of the defense acquisition community, and as a fellow survivor of the federal IT enterprise, thank you.**\n\n**Sivilli:** Charge it to the program.\n\n---\n\n*Cost Plus Technologies is a registered defense contractor. The ALLOSAUR Heavy Ground Dominance Platform is currently in Limited User Testing. John Hammond was unavailable for comment. InGen Corporation did not respond to a request for comment, possibly because they no longer exist as a functioning entity. Dr. Ashworth's views are his own and do not represent the official position of any agency, department, command, or sentient apex predator.

Dr. James Nicholas Ashworth, D.Sc., returned to speak with Rob \"The Boss\" Sivilli about the deployment of the PTERODACTYL Counter-Unmanned Aerial System to CVN-87, the subsequent incident now being referred to in certain circles as \"The Bite of '87,\" and what the company's path forward looks like. Mr. Sivilli requested that we note, for the record, that he is \"completely calm\" about all of this.*\n\n---\n\n**Dr. James Nicholas Ashworth, D.Sc.: Rob. CVN-87. Walk me through it.**\n\n**Rob \"The Boss\" Sivilli:** I want to start by saying that Petty Officer Fischbach is doing extremely well. He is responsive, he is communicative, and according to the ship's medical officer, he is living proof that the frontal lobe is, in the words of the official medical report, \"not a strictly load-bearing neurological structure.\" Those are the doctor's words. I'm just repeating them.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: The sailor who was bitten.**\n\n**Sivilli:** Who was *grazed.* The after-action report uses the word \"grazed.\" We fought very hard for that word.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: The official NCIS report uses \"bite.\"**\n\n**Sivilli:** The official NCIS report uses a lot of words. It also uses \"unauthorized engagement envelope exceedance,\" which I think more accurately captures what happened from a systems perspective. The PTERODACTYL unit was operating within its defined behavioral parameters — *we think* — and Petty Officer Fischbach made a movement near the flight deck that the unit's threat-discrimination algorithm interpreted as, and I'm going to use the technical term here, a drone.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: He was carrying a coffee mug.**\n\n**Sivilli:** A very fast coffee mug. We are reviewing the sensor calibration.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Let's back up. For readers who aren't familiar, describe the PTERODACTYL system.**\n\n**Sivilli:** Absolutely. The **PTERODACTYL Precision Threat Elimination and Rapid Organic Denial of Aerial Craft Technology with Ychromosomal Logic** — the acronym took three weeks and I stand behind it — is Cost Plus Technologies' answer to the low-altitude UAS threat. It is a pterosaur-derived, avian-genomics-based counter-drone platform with a wingspan of approximately four meters, a top airspeed that we are contractually prohibited from disclosing, and a threat-interdiction methodology that I would describe as \"extremely thorough.\"\n\nIt uses bird DNA. I cannot stress this enough. We are not InGen. We did not cut corners with amphibian genomics. Every PTERODACTYL unit was sequenced from a certified avian baseline, which means it is, taxonomically speaking, a very large, very fast, very motivated seabird with a beak the length of a regulation softball bat.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: And it was deployed to CVN-87 specifically.**\n\n**Sivilli:** CVN-87, yes. The *USS Gerald R. Ford*-class vessel currently under the command of Captain Jeremy Fitzgerald, who I want to say is an outstanding naval officer who has handled this entire situation with extraordinary professionalism, especially given his, let's call it, *personal history* with bite-related incidents. The man is a survivor in every sense of the word. We have enormous respect for him.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: I'm not going to ask about that.**\n\n**Sivilli:** Appreciate it.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: The ship's designation — CVN-87. You didn't flag that as potentially inauspicious before deployment?**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(long pause)*\n\nOur Program Manager flagged it. In writing. There is a memo. I chose not to act on the memo, which in hindsight I acknowledge was a program management decision that did not age well. It is now a standing agenda item in our weekly risk review. We have a new policy: any contract involving the number 87 in the hull designation, contract vehicle number, or CLIN structure triggers an automatic safety review. We are calling it the Fitzgerald Protocol.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: How is Captain Fitzgerald responding to having a safety protocol named after him?**\n\n**Sivilli:** He has not responded to our emails. His XO sent us a very terse one-sentence reply that I am advised not to quote in a public forum.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Let's talk about Petty Officer Fischbach. How is he actually doing?**\n\n**Sivilli:** Mark is doing great. Genuinely. He was remarkably composed during the incident — by all accounts he stood there for approximately twenty seconds with a completely blank expression, just processing what had happened, and then looked directly at the ship's camera system and said, and I am told this is an exact quote: *\"Was that the Bite of '87?\"*\n\nWhich, honestly, is a level of presence of mind under pressure that I find impressive. That man has a future in crisis communications if he ever leaves the Navy.\n\nWe have also, at the company's expense, sent him a very nice fruit basket and a Kevlar flight deck helmet with enhanced cranial protection. The helmet is rated for pterosaur beak impact up to approximately forty miles per hour. The PTERODACTYL unit in question was traveling at approximately forty-three miles per hour at the moment of contact. We are working on the next revision.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: I feel obligated to ask: is the frontal lobe comment from the medical officer a real assessment, or is that some kind of legal positioning?**\n\n**Sivilli:** It's real, it's in the report, and it is also — and I say this with tremendous gratitude — almost verbatim language from a DoD medical document that was used in a completely unrelated incident in 1987. I have cited it in our incident response. Our legal team called it \"an inspired use of precedent.\"\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: InGen must be having a field day.**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(visibly tightening)*\n\nInGen. Yes. We have been made aware that a representative of InGen's successor entity — I will not name them, they know who they are — sent a statement to two defense trade publications suggesting that this incident, quote, \"validates concerns about the use of unproven biological platforms in active fleet environments.\"\n\nThis from a company whose flagship product ate a lawyer on its opening day. On a *toilet*. Their entire liability record is one long argument against their own credibility, and they have the audacity to issue *statements* about our quality assurance process. Their assets used frog DNA. Their assets could spontaneously reorganize their own reproductive biology. Our asset had a sensor calibration issue. These are not equivalent problems.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: To be scrupulously fair: their assets did not bite a sailor on a carrier.**\n\n**Sivilli:** Their assets ate *guests*. Paying guests. On a commercial property open to the public. We had one, single, documented beak-to-cranium contact event on a hardened military vessel in a controlled operational environment, and the sailor *survived with full cognitive function.* I'll take that trade every time over whatever liability exposure comes with having a Velociraptor loose in a visitor center.\n\nAlso — and I want this in the record — the PTERODACTYL successfully intercepted fourteen Group 2 UAS threats in the three days prior to the Fischbach incident. Fourteen. It has a 100% interdiction rate against actual targets. The Fischbach event represents a 6.7% friendly-contact rate against non-drone targets on the flight deck. In acquisition terms, that is well within acceptable system immaturity thresholds for a Milestone B program.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: I'm confident no one has ever used those words in that order before in a Senate hearing.**\n\n**Sivilli:** We have a hearing in six weeks. I have already used them in that order, in a draft opening statement, twice.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Any modifications to the program going forward?**\n\n**Sivilli:** Several. First, the threat-discrimination logic is being updated to deprioritize slow-moving, low-thermal-signature objects below a certain altitude threshold — we're calling this the \"coffee mug exclusion zone.\" Second, all flight deck personnel will be issued the aforementioned cranial protection. Third, we are looking at a behavioral conditioning update to better distinguish between a DJI Phantom 4 and a human being holding a beverage.\n\nWe are also — and this is not officially announced — exploring a daytime restriction protocol for the PTERODACTYL units while the ship is at general quarters. We will limit their free-roaming mode to nighttime operations only, to prevent any further engagement envelope ambiguity. Our Chief Behavioral Systems Architect calls this the \"servo lockup prevention protocol.\" We call it \"not letting the pterosaur walk around the carrier in the daytime.\" It amounts to the same thing.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: That is essentially the exact lesson that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza learned in 1987.**\n\n**Sivilli:** *(long silence)*\n\nYes. It is. And I want to be clear: we arrived at this independently, through rigorous after-action analysis, and not because a DoD IG investigator left a printout of a Wikipedia article on my desk with the relevant paragraph highlighted in yellow. That did not happen.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Final question. What do you want the defense acquisition community to take away from this?**\n\n**Sivilli:** That biological platforms in operationally contested environments require iterative refinement, and that iterative refinement sometimes involves a sailor named Mark and a very enthusiastic pterosaur. That is not a failure. That is the developmental process. Every transformative defense capability in history has had a Fischbach moment. We have learned from ours. We have documented our lessons learned, updated our TTP's, and submitted a contract modification request for the enhanced helmet program that I am confident will be approved, funded, and delivered before CVN-87 completes its current deployment.\n\nWe are the professionals. We use bird DNA. We file our paperwork. And when our system bites a sailor, we send fruit.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ashworth: Rob, thank you. And please pass along our best wishes to Petty Officer Fischbach.**\n\n**Sivilli:** He knows. He's been following the blog.\n\n---\n\n*Cost Plus Technologies is a registered defense contractor.
